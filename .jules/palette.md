## 2024-05-23 - Consistency in Input Interactions
**Learning:** Users expect consistent behavior across similar inputs. If the login form has a "Show Password" toggle, the "Add Password" form should too. Inconsistent interaction patterns can lead to frustration, especially when generating random passwords that the user wants to verify.
**Action:** When implementing a feature (like password visibility) in one part of the auth flow, verify if it should be applied to all similar inputs throughout the application.
