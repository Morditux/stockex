## 2024-05-22 - Keyboard Shortcut Accessibility
**Learning:** Users who rely on keyboards often expect standard shortcuts like `/` or `Cmd+K` for search. Adding these shortcuts with visual hints (using `<kbd>` tags) significantly improves navigability for power users without cluttering the UI for others.
**Action:** When implementing search or primary navigation features, always consider adding standard keyboard shortcuts and indicating them with a subtle visual cue (e.g., inside the input field). Ensure to trap focus correctly and prevent shortcuts from triggering when the user is already typing in a form field.
